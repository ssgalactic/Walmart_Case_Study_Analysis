   Tailor marketing strategies to incentivize higher spending among male customers, who account for a significant portion of Black Friday sales.

2. **Focus on 26 - 45 Age Group**  
   Cater to the preferences of customers aged 26-45, who contribute to the majority of sales.

3. **Engage Younger Shoppers**  
   Increase spending among the 0-17 age group by offering discounts, coupons, or rewards programs.

4. **Customer Segmentation**  
   Optimize product selection and pricing strategies based on similar buying characteristics in specific age groups.

5. **Enhance 51 - 55 Age Group Shopping Experience**  
   Provide exclusive pre-sale access, special discounts, or personalized recommendations to customers aged 51-55.

6. **Post-Black Friday Engagement**  
   Engage with customers post-Black Friday through follow-up emails or offers to encourage repeat business.

## Results

- **Target Male Shoppers**: Male customers accounted for a significant portion of Black Friday sales and tended to spend more per transaction on average. The recommendation is to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to incentivize higher spending among male customers while ensuring competitive pricing for female-oriented products.
  
- **Focus on 26 - 45 Age Group**: The age group between 26 and 45 contributed to the majority of sales. Walmart should specifically cater to the preferences and needs of this demographic, potentially offering exclusive deals on products popular among this age group.
  
- **Engage Younger Shoppers**: Customers in the 0-17 age group had the lowest spending per transaction. Walmart can try to increase their spending per transaction by offering more attractive discounts, coupons, or rewards programs, focusing on building brand loyalty among younger consumers.
  
- **Customer Segmentation**: Customers in the 18-25, 26-35, and 46-50 age groups exhibited similar buying characteristics, while customers in the 36-45 and 55+ age groups had different patterns. Walmart can optimize its product selection to cater to these preferences and adjust pricing strategies accordingly.
  
- **Enhance 51 - 55 Age Group Shopping Experience**: Customers aged 51-55 had the highest spending per transaction. Offering them exclusive pre-sale access, special discounts, or personalized product recommendations could be highly beneficial. Introducing loyalty programs specifically designed to reward and retain customers in this age group is also recommended.
  
- **Post-Black Friday Engagement**: Post-Black Friday, Walmart should engage with customers who made purchases by sending follow-up emails or offers for related products to increase customer retention and encourage repeat business throughout the holiday season and beyond.
